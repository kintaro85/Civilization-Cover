# Civilization-Cover
As a training exercise I tried to write a game inspired by Civilization using the pygame package.

The project has not been completed as it was mostly being created as a practice exercise to expriment with
the foundation principles of OOP, packages, imports, classes, functions etc.

As it was a trainig exercise and mostly improvised the code remains hard to read and messy, with old comments
being kept and comment sections still missing

I have implemented a "world" containing 18 "land" objects, each containg 25 "blocks" objects.

New folder contains images and sounds i have used to play around.

I tried to implement features of the original game: 

-the undiscored map rapresented visually as a "fog", wich dissipates as new land get 
discovered and settled.

-a randomize land type, with specific types of resaurce raprsented by the "blocks" which are randomly set at "runtime".

-different types of citizens with different task.

-an attempt at a technologie system was started.

-a text document records the score and display the top 10 in the "hall of fame".
